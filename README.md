# Pik (achu) http tool

-------

Named after the legendary Pikachu, for no reason other than he is cool, and my kids love him.

pik is my spin on the epic curl tool. Why would anybody use pik over curl? Currently there isn't any, and I don't plan on making any. Curl is awesome, and it is a very extensive tool. I just like like fixing unbroken things.

The honest reason for pik besides attempting to reinvent the wheel... I am working on a project that will be using pik, and I basically am interested in a bare bones, curl, that I can tweak to my hearts delight.
